We know one of the main characteristics of Java is portability, and that usually means it is not as efficient as it should be. That might be the reason Java has never been associated with high performance, but nowadays there are a lot of Java powered devices in the world and lots of people are building applications for them. In this session you will not only learn how to make your Android code faster but also what to avoid when looking for critical performance and a bigger understanding of how the Java compiler works, and how these small changes affect to Dalvik VM and the new ART runtime.","id":"19348","isLivestream":false,"title":"ART Runtime and Dalvik VM","endTimestamp":"2014-11-24T10:15:00Z","url":"","startTimestamp":"2014-11-24T09:30:00Z","room":"ROOM67","tags":["TYPE_SESSION","THEME_1216"]},{"photoUrl":"http://www.droidcon.nl/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/joan92-92x92.png","color":"#009688","speakers":["18799"],"description":"After working many years with Android and other platforms Joan Puig Sanz got a little bit tired of implementing the same thing in different platforms so he decided to try the same way as the game developers\u2026 Using C++. C++ could sound very scary, but the latest versions of C++ have improved a lot the way of working with it. Now with C++ 11 developers can develop faster and safer (very nice patterns and tool for the memory management, threading, etc) Conclusion: If you want to maintain the nice user experience of each platform, it is not a good idea to use a magical solution that will create a unified UI for all the platforms. With C++ the developers can create a common core written with c++ that can be connected with the UI in order to provide the best user experience of each platform.

In his talk Tony Atkins will talk about hidden accessibility features your apps may already have , why your users need the GPII, and how to add support to your apps. Android provides a low-cost platform that allows people to interact with the world on their own terms. This platform is powerful, but the power to configure these options is limited to people who can see and touch the device. Even for people who can see and touch a device, each new device requires days or weeks of adjustment to get back to the same comfort level. The Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure helps ensure that each new device adapts to a user\u2019s needs from the moment they start using it. The GPII also helps devices keep up with a user\u2019s needs as they change.","id":"19374","isLivestream":false,"title":"Adapting to user needs in real time using the GPII","endTimestamp":"2014-11-25T15:30:00Z","url":"","startTimestamp":"2014-11-25T14:45:00Z","room":"ROOM67","tags":["TYPE_SESSION","THEME_1216"]},{"photoUrl":"http://www.droidcon.nl/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sebastian92.png","color":"#ff9800","speakers":["19372"],"description":"Sebastiano Poggi will show that The Canvas is one of the worst documented APIs on Android, and yet it\u2019s the one that every app uses to draw their UIs. The talk will present an overview of what are the components of the Android UI subsystem, and of the 2D rendering pipeline and its components. There is no trace on the Internet of a comprehensive and easy-to-understand guide that covers every and all aspects of the Android UI subsystem. Skia, a pretty important component, for example, has almost no documentation at all. Conclusion: This \u201cmissing documentation\u201d, gathered by looking at the AOSP code and putting various pieces together, is condensed in a talk. The session will help developers master their UIs, optimise their graphics handling, and ultimately grip the base concepts that allow to create beautiful Views with the minimum effort and the best performances.","id":"19373","isLivestream":false,"title":"Framing the Canvas","endTimestamp":"2014-11-25T15:30:00Z","url":"","startTimestamp":"2014-11-25T14:45:00Z","room":"ROOM70","tags":["TYPE_SESSION","THEME_1216"]},{"photoUrl":"http://www.droidcon.nl/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/alexander92.png","color":"#009688","speakers":["21225"],"description":"Over the course of 2014, there have been a large number of breaches and disclosed vulnerabilities that allowed both whitehat and blackhat hackers to run wild on the global public facing internet.
