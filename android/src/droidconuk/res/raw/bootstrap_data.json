Android users understand functionality of components like the navigation drawer, action bar, sharing and many more. However, the guidelines are just that, guidelines, not rules.\r\n\r\nAll Android apps should not look alike but neither should they all reinvent all the controls. In this presentation Juhani will take a deep dive into details of the common design patterns and how they can be customised without compromising usability.\r\n\r\nI want to help developers and designers alike to understand how to correctly use Android UI design patterns.","id":"1017","isLivestream":false,"title":"Dear developers, design details matter","endTimestamp":"2014-10-31T10:45:00Z","url":"http://uk.droidcon.com/2014/sessions/juhani-lehtimaki/","startTimestamp":"2014-10-31T10:00:00Z","room":"59","tags":["TYPE_SESSION","TOPIC_1003"]}],"hashtags":[{"color":"#A4C639","name":"#droidconuk","description":"Droidcon London 2014","order":1}],"partners":[],"blocks":[{"start":"2014-10-30T08:30:00.000Z","end":"2014-10-30T09:00:00.000Z","title":"Welcome to Droidcon London 2014"},{"start":"2014-10-30T09:00:00.000Z","end":"2014-10-30T10:00:00.000Z","title":"Barcamp Kickoff"},{"start":"2014-10-30T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2014-10-30T17:15:00.000Z","title":"Democamp"},{"start":"2014-10-31T08:30:00.000Z","end":"2014-10-31T09:30:00.000Z","title":"Breakfast and Registration"},{"start":"2014-10-31T09:45:00.000Z","end":"2014-10-31T10:00:00.000Z","title":"Coffee Break"}],"speakers":[{"name":"Chet Haase","bio":"Chet is the lead of the Android UI Toolkit team.
