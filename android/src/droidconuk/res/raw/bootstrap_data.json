This is what everyone asks you to focus on. It\u2019s a very important criterion which decides whether an application will really click or just fade off.\r\n\r\nBut what exactly is usability ? Researchers talk about \u2018Basic Human Instincts\u2019, experts talk about the \u2018Useful, Usable and Desirable\u2019 paradigm, and designers talk about \u2018Themes and Colors\u2019. This leaves the poor developer confused as to where to start, and what to focus on. Usability is not just about look and feel of the app, but also about how you build an app that is smooth, responsive, consistent, optimized in memory and battery usage, and at the same time pleasant on the eyes. By following a few guidelines, which may not be evident to all, we could actually improve usability of applications by leaps and bounds. In this session you\u2019ll learn how to solve this problem by concentrating on the basics. We\u2019ll focus on an app which is functionally complete but lacks good user experience.

That might be the reason Java has never been associated with high performance, but nowadays there are a lot of Java powered devices in the world and lots of people are building applications for them.\r\n\r\nCompilers that produce native machine code do a great optimisation job because they know where the code is going to be executed. But because of the portability feature, the Java Compiler could not assume anything about where our program is going to run and leaves all the optimisations to be done by the JVM while loading or, even, running our code (or converting it to native code in the case of ART)\r\n\r\nHaving that in mind, we will explore what can be done to help the compiler produce optimal code which, in fact, will make the life easier of the Dalvik VM or ART.\r\n\r\nIn this session you will not only learn how to make your Android code faster but also what to avoid when looking for critical performance and a bigger understanding of how the Java compiler works, and how these small changes affect to Dalvik VM and the new ART runtime.","id":"1094","isLivestream":false,"title":"How to improve android app performance with the new ART Runtime and Dalvik VM","endTimestamp":"2014-10-31T17:30:00Z","url":"http://uk.droidcon.com/2014/sessions/how-to-improve-android-app-performance-with-the-new-art-runtime-and-dalvik-vm/","startTimestamp":"2014-10-31T16:45:00Z","room":"ROOM61","tags":["TYPE_SESSION","THEME_1003"]},{"photoUrl":"http://uk.droidcon.com/2014/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unnamed.jpg","color":"#A4C639","speakers":["1085","1086"],"description":"A deep dive into the Material design system for both designers and developers.
