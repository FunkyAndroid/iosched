{"sessions":[{"id":"364","title":"CheapCast: ChromeCast without ChromeCast","location":"15","description":"Recently hitting the headlines Sebastian Mauer has developed CheapCast, emulating a ChromeCast Dongle on (almost) any Android Device. This involved setting up Service Discovery using SSDP, an HTTP- and WebSocket Server and an Activity to render the actual ChromeCast Receiver WebApp. What Sebastian found out is that the Android WebView is kind of limited and needed to be enhanced to be usable for realizing a ChromeCast Emulator. Sebastian will show that during the development of CheapCast the WebView was extended to support WebSockets using a special JavaScript Interface with bindings to Java Code.","subtype":"KEYNOTE","startTimestamp":1385371800,"webLink":"","presenterIds":["363"],"endTimestamp":1385374500},{"id":"366","title":"Google GLASS","location":"16","description":"Rob Rusher from On3 Inc will fly in from Denver and present the most interesting example of wearable computing to date: Google GLASS Come experience what it is like to use and develop applications for Google GLASS.

Culture is about what we want to improve, what we want to foster, what we want to encourage. Culture is about what we want to cultivate. Culture, really, is about what we want to define us. Culture is hard to contain in a pithy statement, even one as nice as \u201coptimize for happiness\u201d.","subtype":"SESSION","startTimestamp":1385460900,"webLink":"","presenterIds":["357"],"endTimestamp":1385463600}]}
